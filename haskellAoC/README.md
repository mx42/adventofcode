# Advent of Code - Haskell implementation

Disclaimer: I'm a somewhat noob using Haskell, and not really fluent yet with most advanced functional constructs.

Most of the problems I handle by myself, but for some I had to look at others' solutions, to learn some libs or constructs.


## Usage

Run using `stack run [year] [day]`, with inputs in the dedicated directory.

The app scans for files prefixed with the day number, so you can have multiple test inputs.
